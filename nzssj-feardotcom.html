WarnerBros.com I absolutely love horror movies, and lately I’ve been on a binge - but just recently as I was staring at my laptop thinking of what to watch, I remembered seeing this movie on display at Walmart. I would always pick up the DVD and stare at the cover and as a young child I was completely petrified yet interested in the distorted face plastered on the cover staring back at me. That shit really haunted my dreams and stuck with me. I’ve always wanted to watch this movie, but seeing W każdym momencie możesz zrezygnować. Nie chcesz korzystać? Nie płacisz!

Страх.сом (FeardotCom) - Детектив Майк Рейли занимается расследованием череды странных убийств. Все жертвы были обнаружены с застывшей маской ужаса на лице. Strange, how good "feardotcom" is, and how bad. The screenplay is a mess, and yet the visuals are so creative this is one of the rare bad films you might actually want to see. The plot is a bewildering jumble of half-baked ideas, from which we gather just enough of a glimmer about the story. I'm no stranger to the deepweb, and I know 99% of the stories surrounding it are just that: stories. But for some reason I'm encapsulated by the r/nosleep stories and other such tales that involve the dark side of the internet. The outlandishness and sheer horror of the stories is what I like I think. I've had a look and all I can find is documentaries on Bitcoin, but I would love it if someone could suggest a dark/twisted movie about the dark net. If one doesn't come to mind, a suggestion.

It was about a site where people logged in to watch people/animals be tortured/die and the more that were logged in and viewing the quicker it happened. So one was a cat that was glued by its paws and for every viewer more heat lamps turned on until it was too much and it died. Very morbid and gory, sorry! But this is horror so you shouldn't mind too much.

I remember seeing a trailer for it when I was younger. It probably came out between 2000-2008. The killer was streaming torture on the internet. A female detective or FBI agent was trying to stop it.

Okay, so in the movie, the antagonist is killing a victim, however judges the speed of their death by creating a website that broadcasts the killing in real time. The more people that were tuned into the site, the faster the victim dies. So eventually a news report was made about this warning people not to go to the website.
